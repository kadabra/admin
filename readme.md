# Kadabra Admin

The UI for kadabra server.

This is not on npm, this is the git repo for the admin. 

- If you are looking to **use** the admin, `npm install @kadabra/server` then `kadabra -open` to use it. 

- If you are looking to **develop** the admin, clone this repo. It's a vue cli app, so it's `npm run serve` to start the dev server, but I aliased it to `npm run dev`. Both commands work.
